# Metrics

## Short Description
Metrics and measurement: how do you demonstrate program return on investment?

## Long Description
Metrics and measurements demonstrate the value that a program generates with data. Metrics track various statistics. Program leadership can track statistics across multiple quarters and years to measure program value over some time.

## Overview

| Level | Name | Validation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Maturity 0 | No metrics. | None.
| Maturity 1 | Basic metrics. | Review the metric plan and test the data used to generate metrics.
| Maturity 2 | Intermediate metrics and dashboards. | Review the metric plan and test the data used to generate metrics.
| Maturity 3 | Action-based metrics. | Review the metric plan and test the data used to generate metrics.

## Maturity 0 - No metrics

### Activity
* Build a metrics plan.
* Execute the metrics plan.
  
### Benefit
* Without measurement, nothing ever changes.

## Maturity 1 - Basic metrics
Basic metrics are bulk metrics -- items that count various measurable points with the champion program. 

Example basic metrics:
* Total count of champions
* Business unit/product distribution
* Champion education levels
* Champion flaw density, measuring the number of flaws created per person per one-thousand lines of code.

### Activity
* Incorporate the basic set of metrics into the metrics plan. 

### Benefit
* Basic measurement shows program impact.

## Maturity 2 - Intermediate metrics and dashboards.
Intermediate metrics extend the basic metrics, adding champion/employee NPS (eNPS). eNPS is a methodology for applying Net Promoter Score to an employee population. Extend this directly to champions to measure scNPS or Security Champion Net Promoter Score. scNPS measures how likely a champion is to recommend a colleague join the program.

A dashboard is an information system that correlates and displays various metrics.

### Activity
* Add scNPS to the metrics plan.
* Send out and report on scNPS according to a schedule laid out in the metrics plan.
* Build a dashboard to record and report on champion metrics.

### Benefit
* Intermediate metrics demonstrate the community's impact on the Champions themselves, based on how likely they are to recommend a colleague join the program.
* A dashboard provides visibility into all the metrics tracked.

## Maturity 3 - Action-based metrics
Action-based planning takes the output of metrics and creates and executes improvement plans, improving security and the program with the results of champion metrics and measurement.

### Activity
* Create plans of action based on output metrics.
* Execute the action plans.

### Benefit
* Taking action to improve security as a result of the community improves the organization.
