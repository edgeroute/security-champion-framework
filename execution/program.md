## Maturity 0 - Nothing

No programmatic elements; everything is ad hoc.

### Activity
* Start planning a monthly training session to move to maturity level one.
  
### Benefit
* Ad hoc champion programs are chaos for the participants and cause people to drift away. Build an agenda to breed stability in your environment.

## Maturity 1 - Monthly training

Monthly training is the core piece of the program. It provides an environment for learning and connection amongst the champion population.

Every Champion meeting should focus on providing insight/educative material and working through whatever needs group input. Every group event is a teaching opportunity.

### Activity
* Plan monthly meetings up to twelve months in advance, and add them to champion calendars.
* Provide a mechanism for champions to sign up to speak at a future monthly meeting.
* Reach out to various industry folks and invite them to join a monthly meeting to deliver a talk they have in the bag. 

### Benefit
* Monthly training builds a cadence within the community and provides champion learning.

## Maturity 2 - Special events

Develop special training webinars, internal CTFs, and security days.

### Activity
* Scope and schedule special, champion-only training webinars.
* Create internal capture-the-flag experiences only for the champions.
* Schedule and execute security days, as champion only four or eight-hour events.
* Have champion-only deep-dives into the security of the product and identify security debt, giving champions an opportunity to collectively strategize how to lower the debt.

### Benefit
* Special events grow the knowledge and connection of the community.

## Maturity 3 - Deep effort
Profound events provide value to the champions that allow them to advance their careers.

### Activity
* Schedule and execute multi-day internal champion security conferences.
* Pay for and provide special champion certification training. The ISC2 CSSLP is a nice companion certification for champions. To provide true value, ensure the champion does not pay anything out of pocket for the class or the certification exam.
* Send a selection of champions to a regional or national security conference, covering all expenses.
* Develop an advanced degree focusing on cybersecurity, and provide this to your champions with no out-of-pocket expense.

### Benefit
* Provides true rewards to those that dedicate their time to building a security community.
