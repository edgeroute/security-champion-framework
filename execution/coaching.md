# Coaching

## Short Description
Coaching: how will you provide consulting and one too training?

## Long Description
Security coaches are to developers, as life coaches are to health and wellness. A solid security coach works with a developer one-on-one or one too few for a short period, assisting and teaching one area or helping to resolve one challenge. Then the security coach moves on to another set of folks to work with and help succeed.

A coach could cover subjects such as threat modeling, using SAST or DAST, and advising on a tough security challenge.

To be a successful security coach, an individual must have a solid development background. Walking a mile in a developer's shoes goes a long way towards showing that developer that the coach cares enough to understand the subject for which they are providing consulting. The coach must also have a solid background in application and product security. The final piece for success is soft skills- communicating with a small group of developers and adapting communication and collaboration styles to make the group successful. Communication is crucial, and the best coaches connect with developers.
