# Globalization

## Short Description
Globalization: how do you build a program if you're a worldwide company?

## Long Description
Globalization is a hurdle that you must clear as you build up your program. Most large companies have offices all over the world. Globalization provides opportunities to engage your global community, providing programmatic efforts aimed at their local time zone. Instead of thinking of champions as only mattering in your local time zone, engage your champions worldwide with a solid globalization strategy.
