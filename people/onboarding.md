# Onboarding

## Short Description
Onboarding answers the question, "how are you going to get a new, inexperienced Champion embedded into the Champions Program, so they feel at home?".

## Long Description
When a new person becomes a Security Champion, they likely have yet to learn what to expect. If you only invite them to a monthly meeting, with no context for what they should expect, you are setting them up for failure. On the other hand, there is an opportunity with onboarding to welcome a new Champion and set them up for a long and successful time within the Program.
